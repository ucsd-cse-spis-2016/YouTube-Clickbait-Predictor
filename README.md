#Brief Description

Plan to determine elements that makes a video "clickbait", design program that allows user to enter video title to determine potential to be clickbait. 

#Stages

Stage 1: Pick a set of videos from a certain time period and scrape the views and dislikes from each video. Determine threshold for clickbait based on the ratio of dislikes/views.

Stage 2: Separate "regular" videos and "clickbait" videos. Determine which words are associated with clickbait videos.

Stage 3: Look at other factors of the video (duration, category, comments) that might associate with clickbait vidoes.

Stage 4: Design program that allows users to input a video title and returns the "clickbait potential" that that title has.
